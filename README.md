# studyingbot
A discord bot to help remind you to take breaks from studying

## usage
To use, get the bot ID from discord and paste it into the code, then run from your favorite code editor or command prompt.
To use in discord, type !start and !end to begin and end study sessions. When you set this up, please keep in mind that I set the timer to 0.01 seconds to test the response.
You should set the timer to 30 minutes or whatever your alloted "study time" is. The bot will remind you when you need to take a break.

## future features
You could easily adapt this code to have it remind you when your break is over, as well. For example, 30 minute "stop studying" reminders, and 30 minute "start", offset by five minutes.
This would allow for "pomodoro" type studying, where it's 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off. It would be easier to code this way than to code in 25 minute "start" and 5 minute "stop", but less flexible without maths.
